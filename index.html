              <h1>Walter White</h1>
              <strong>Breaking Bad</strong> follows protagonist <strong>Walter White</strong>, a high school chemistry teacher and family man, who learns he has inoperable lung cancer. To secure his family's financial future, he begins making meth with <strong>Jesse Pinkman</strong>, a former student. The two become known for their top-quality blue meth, but success has its complications: Walt finds himself in over his head in the drug underworld. Meanwhile, a DEA team led by Walt's brother-in-law, <strong>Hank Schrader</strong>, begins investigating "Heisenberg," Walt's alter ego.
